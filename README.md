# DNase-seq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and resources for the analysis of DNase-seq (DNase I sequencing) data. DNase-seq is a high-throughput technique used to identify open chromatin regions in the genome by sequencing the DNA fragments cleaved by the DNase I enzyme.

The analysis pipeline includes preprocessing of raw sequencing data, alignment to the reference genome, peak calling to identify open chromatin regions, and downstream functional analysis of these regions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Trim Galore](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)
- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) or [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
- [MACS2](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS)
- [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
- [Bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dnase-seq-analysis.git
   cd dnase-seq-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure that all required dependencies listed above are installed and configured properly on your system.

3. **Preprocessing:**

   - Preprocess raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) using Trim Galore for adapter trimming and quality filtering.

4. **Alignment:**

   - Map cleaned reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2 or BWA.

5. **Peak Calling:**

   - Identify open chromatin regions (peaks) using MACS2.

6. **Functional Analysis:**

   - Perform downstream functional analysis to understand the biological significance of the identified open chromatin regions.

7. **Visualization:**

   - Visualize the DNase-seq data and identified peaks using genome browsers or custom plotting tools.

8. **Documentation:**

   - Document the analysis steps, parameters used, and results obtained for reproducibility.
